Welcome to Documentation Assistant, your AI-powered sidekick for navigating the labyrinth of software documentation and GitHub issues! 🎉

## 🌟 What is Documentation Assistant?

Documentation Assistant is a StreamLit app that turns the chore of searching through documentation into a breeze. It's like having a super-smart intern who has read all the docs and GitHub issues, and is ready to answer your questions instantly!

### 🔍 Key Features:

- 🕷️ Web Crawler: Slurps up documentation from any URL you feed it
- 🐙 GitHub Integration: Fetches and indexes issues from your favorite repos
- 🧠 AI-Powered Search: Uses fancy vector magic to find the answers you need
- 💬 Chat Interface: Ask questions in plain English, get answers in a snap!
